# Session 9 Assignment

This assignment is for using advanced convolutions and data augmentations techniques on cisfar10 dataset 


## DataAugmentation

we have used three data augmentation techniques
1.horizontal flip
2.shiftScaleRotate
3.coarseDropout

## Advanced convolution

### Dilated convolution

we have used dilated convolution in the first layer to increase the rf in the first layer.

### Depthwise seperable convolution

we have used depth wise seperable convolution in the third convolution block

## Training Summary

1. parameters - 199,264
2. Best Training accuracy - 76.21
3. Best Test accuracy - 83.71
