# Session 7 Assignment

This assignment is for classification of digit in MNIST dataset and following steps That are there in session 7.
we tried to improve the model in three steps by consolidating 10 steps
## Steps

### First model
#### Target
1. Setup
2. Create a skelton
3. Make model Lighter
4. Add GAP here to get sense of number of parameters
5. Use bigger kernels with less count to match parameters and also receptive field

#### Result
1. parameters - 5,450
2. Best Training accuracy - 99.19
3. Best Test accuracy - 99.06

#### Analysis
1. Good Model
2. we see some overfitting

### Second model


#### Target
1. Reduce the accuracy between train and test
2. Increase capacity


#### Result
1. parameters - 8,310
2. Best Training accuracy - 98.48
3. Best Test accuracy - 99.13

#### Analysis
1. Good Model
2. But Test accuracy is not where we want it to be
3. will try to augment images

### Third model

#### Target
1. Increase the accuracy by augmenting images
2. Adjust lr to make the model accuracy stable


#### Result
1. parameters - 7,494
2. Best Training accuracy - 99.25
3. Best Test accuracy - 98.43

### Analysis
1. Good Model
2. Underfitting but Test accuracy is closer
