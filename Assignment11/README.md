# Session 10 Assignment

This assignment is for using Resnet architecture also using One cycle policy by calculating LR min and LR max using Leslie method  


## DataAugmentation

we have used three data augmentation techniques
1.Random crop
2.FlipLR
3.CoarseDropout

## one cycle policy

LRMIN=0.00368
LRMAX=0.00368



## Training Summary

1. parameters - 6,594,160
2. Best Training accuracy - 76.21
3. Best Test accuracy - 83.71
